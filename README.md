# Disk_Queue
A representation of different types of queues in a simulated disk. 
The input is a file that consists of a time, track, and sector of a request that comes in.
There are five different variations of disk ordering that I included in my implementation, and 
these take in all of the requests and place them in the correct order that they would be fulfilled
in a regular disk.
